# 2023-Vector-Build
This repository is for tracking tasks related to building the FRC team
Vector 8177 robot for the 2023 season.
The repository will primarily be used for the issue and project tracker, but
may also be used to store gcode or other fabrication files which are created
from the OnShape CAD project.
